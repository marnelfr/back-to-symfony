## API Platform
Installation: ``composer req api``

To make an entity, an api resource, just add ``#[ApiResource]`` of
top of the entity.

To display the data send by an api point, add the format as extension
to the link otherwise, api_platform show those data through its
doc.\
e.g.: ``https://localhost/api/cheese_listings/2.jsonld``

## OpenAPI
The Swagger doc generated by api_platform (ap) is generated thanks to 
OpenAPI. We can even display the OpenAPI code generated by ap via
the link\
``https://localhost/api/docs.json`` \
It's even possible to generate the frontend js code that can 
communicate with our api using **Swagger Codegen**, 
some tools provided by swagger.

## RDF
Stand for **Resource Description Framework**. It's a set of rules about 
how we can describe the meaning of data.
JsonLD add some extra fields to our json in order to help machine 
understanding our API.

### @id
In a Rest API, every URL represent a resource and should have its 
own identifier. That's why thanks to JsonLD, every resource has 
the ``@id`` filed representing when concatenate to our API
domain name, the unique identifier of our resource across the 
entire internet: it's the **IRI** (Internationalized 
Resource Identifier).

### @context
Provide a link to machine to really understand our resource. In our
case, the complete url will be\
``https://localhost:8000/api/contexts/CheeseListing`` \
Here, every think is listed to help machine understanding really
what our resource actually represent. We can even make it more
informational by providing description for our entities properties.

### @type
A resume from information provided by @context that let machine 
know about our resource's type.


## Profiler
Installation: ``composer req profiler --dev``\
While we can install the debugger ``req debug`` to get an extra 
debug tools in addition to the profiler, it can be installed alone.

### Operations
We've got 2 type of operations:
- **collectionOperation**: doesn't require a resource's Id. It has
  - a GET method: to retrieve a collection of resource
  - a POST method: to create a collection of resource
- **itemOperation**: require a resource Id and has
  - a GET method
  - a PUT method: to edit the whole resource
  - a PATCH method: to only edit some fields of our resource.
  - a DELETE method: to destroy a resource.

So while setting up our resource, we can define which kind or 
operation we want our API to expose:
````php 
#[ApiResource(
    collectionOperations: ['GET', 'POST'],
    itemOperations: ['GET', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'],
)]
````
Removing any of these array value will remove the api endpoint.\
And each of them, we can be customized if transformed into a key
with its config as value:\
``'GET' => ['path' => '/lov/de/{id}']``

## ApiResource's properties
- shortName: 'Cheese': to rename our resource
